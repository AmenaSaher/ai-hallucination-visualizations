# AI Hallucination Cases (2023–2025)

This project looks at how often AI tools - like ChatGPT, Copilot, and others - have been linked to “hallucination” incidents between 2023 and 2025.  
I’m using Tableau and SQL to explore when, where, and how these cases appear.

### Tools
- DBeaver for querying and exploring the dataset
- Tableau for charts  
- MySQL: database backend

**Dataset:** [AI Hallucination Cases 2025 – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/umerhaddii/ai-hallucination-cases-data-2025)
